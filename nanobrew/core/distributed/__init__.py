'''
The distributed package is the package that can be used by plugins and endpoints.
It exposes interfaces to implement and objects to configure how nanobrew acts.

This package should be changed as little as possible to limit the amount of
rework done when new features hit nanobrew, and we should aim for backward
compatibility.
